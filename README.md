Project Proposal: Basic Car Management Simulation
Introduction
The "Basic Car Management Simulation" project aims to create a simple yet effective simulation of a car management system. 
This project will help beginners understand and apply fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by modeling basic car behaviors and interactions.

Objectives
Simulate basic operations of a car management system.
Implement key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and methods.
Provide a straightforward project that demonstrates the use of OOP in a practical scenario.
Key Features
Car Simulation:

Classes: Car, ElectricCar, GasCar
Attributes: Make, model, year, color, fuel level, battery level (for electric cars)
Behaviors: Start, stop, drive, refuel/recharge

Garage Management:
                  Classes: Garage
                  Attributes: Capacity, list of cars
                  Behaviors: Add car, remove car, list cars, find car by make/model
